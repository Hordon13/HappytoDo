# Happy to Do

This is a demo to-do application made for Happy at Work to showcase what I learned about frontend development since my last test at the end of September. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating this : )

### Features

- You can easily create and edit ToDos, mark as done tasks or delete them
- The date picker is a 3rd party component from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-ctk-date-time-picker)
- The whole app implements the Happy at Work design language based on the website
- The backend is created via [mockAPI](https://www.mockapi.io)

### During this project I learned...

- the basics of HTML, CSS
- the basics of JavaScript
  - Higher-order functions
  - Callbacks
  - Promises
  - Async/await
  - Fat arrow syntax
- the basics of Vue
  - main app structure
  - components: html template, data, props, methods, computed, scoped style
  - directives: v-bind, v-for, v-if/else
  - life-cycle methods
