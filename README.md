# Happy to Do

This is a demo to-do application made for Happy at Work to showcase what I learned about frontend development since my last test at the end of September. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating this : )

### Features

- For a personalized experience you can create an account and log in to the app
- You can easily create and edit to-dos, mark as done tasks or delete them
- The date picker is a 3rd party component from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-ctk-date-time-picker)
- The whole app implements the Happy at Work design language based on the website but I reinterpreted some tidbits
- The mock backend is created via [mockAPI](https://www.mockapi.io)
- The project is deployed via GitHub Pages but I also tried deployment with Docker
